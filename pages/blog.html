        I've been staying way too late working recently, for my job. On Friday I reached some peak of feeling annoyed. But then I found peace. And today I woke up at peace. The reason was that I feel pressure to work on my projects, but then I am just tired from even thinking about it sometimes. And if job is demanding, it's not a good combination. But maybe I'm too soft.

        I got my first subscribers and a comment! Wow. There are souls out there who watched my video and decided to stay for more <3

        In the afternoon I went for a wonderful walk at the river. It was very windy, on the cold side, and rain intertwined with sunshine. It was great. The wind with the rain were smacking my face and it felt so refreshing.

        Today I finally uploaded my 1st youtube video! After 5 months since I got the idea that I want to make youtube videos. 5 months!!! There were lots of hiccups and things I learned.
