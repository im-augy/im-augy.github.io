<br/>Hi! I'm Augy :) <br/>
I'm a sometimes lost soul who's trying to find her true self. <br/>
An adult woman who didn't foget her inner child. <br/>
A music producer / composer, writer and singer. <br/>
I also like to paint and draw, and recently I started making videos. <br/>
9-5 I work as IT product manager and it's the most fun job I've had so far. <br/>
Maybe I can marry the two worlds that are sometimes difficult to switch between.<br/><br/>
